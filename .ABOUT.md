## Overview

Apollo Link Printer is a logging library designed to provide a pretty and informative log of your Apollo GraphQL network operations. It logs details of your GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions, making it easier to debug and understand the network interactions in your application.

The library extends the `ApolloLink` from `@apollo/client` and provides a custom `PrinterLink` that logs various aspects of the network operations, such as fragments, variables, and messages.

## Installation
Node Package Manager installation
```shell
npm install apollo-link-printer
```
Yarn installation
```shell
yarn add apollo-link-printer
```
---

## Usage

Below is an example of how to set up Apollo Link Printer in your Apollo Client configuration:

```js
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, HttpLink, ApolloLink } from '@apollo/client';
import { PrinterLink } from 'apollo-link-printer';

// Define options
const options = {
  print: true,
  collapsed: false,
};

const client = new ApolloClient({
  link: ApolloLink.from([
    new PrinterLink(options),
    new HttpLink({ uri: 'http://localhost:4000' }),
  ]),
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
```

In this example, `PrinterLink` is added to the Apollo Client link chain. The `options` object allows you to customize the logging behavior.

---

## Options

| name | type | explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ```print``` | boolean | if ```true```, information will be output to the console |
| ```collapsed``` | boolean | if ```true```, ```console.groupCollapsed``` will be used, otherwise ```console.group``` |
